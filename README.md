StatefulJ
=========

[StatefulJ](http://www.statefulj.org) is a lightweight, open source Java [*Event Driven Finite State Machine(FSM)*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_finite-state_machine) and a complete [*Spring Data*](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/) based framework which lets you easily define and integrate State Machines into your Applications.

Features
=========
* Simple, dependency free, in memory implementation of an FSM with support for concurrency and non-deterministic transitions
* Optional Persistence support - currently JPA or Mongo
* Optional Spring Based Framework with autogenerated and autowired Binding and Persistence (SpringMVC, Jersey, Camel, JPA and Mongo)

Documentation
=============
StatefulJ is documented in detail at http://www.statefulj.org

Demos
=====
* The Framework includes:

  * [An FSM with Mongo Persistence support](https://github.com/statefulj/statefulj-persistence-mongo-demo)
  * [A DDD based banking application](https://github.com/statefulj/statefulj-framework-demo-ddd) demonstrating how you can build an entire application using [Domain Driven Design](http://domaindrivendesign.org/), StatefulJ and JPA.
  * [A JPA based banking application](https://github.com/statefulj/statefulj-framework-demo-jpa) demonstrating how you can build an entire application using StatefulJ Framework and JPA.
  * [A Mongo based banking application](https://github.com/statefulj/statefulj-framework-demo-mongo) demonstrating how you can build an entire application using StatefulJ and Mongo.
